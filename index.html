                <p class="p-about">
                    HI THERE! My name is Koby Fink, and I am so glad that you found me! Not that I have been lost or missing or something, I’m just happy you’re here. I recently graduated from Point Park University with my BFA in musical theatre and a minor in dance. Crazy how time flies. I swear I was at my preschool graduation a year or two ago. Maybe three.

                <p class="p-about">
                    I am the proud dog dad to my two incredibly adorable and time-consuming Australian Cattle Dogs, Archie and Tink. I am a sucker for a Squishmallow, especially any that are pink or have dreams of becoming a Broadway star. I love playing piano, re-watching Trixie and Katya videos on YouTube, and drinking an ice-cold Diet Coke. Not at the same time, mostly. It is also impossible for me to see a Broadway show without crying. Especially Frozen. Nothing further.
